- Nmap
- Public test host: `scanme.nmap.org`

Tasks Completed
- Verified Nmap installation:
  - `nmap --version`
- Ran a basic scan:
  - `nmap scanme.nmap.org`
- Collected information on open ports and services.
- Ran a more detailed / aggressive scan for OS and version detection:
  - `nmap -A scanme.nmap.org`
- Saved outputs and screenshots for analysis and documentation.

Skills Demonstrated
- Port scanning and service discovery
- OS and version detection basics
- Reading and interpreting Nmap output
- Applying reconnaissance techniques on legal targets
