In this project, I used Nmap, one of the most important network security tools, to analyze hosts, identify open ports, detect services, and gather operating system information. These scans demonstrate foundational skills in reconnaissance and enumeration, which are core phases of cybersecurity and penetration testing.

1. Verified Installation
I confirmed Nmap was properly installed by using: nmap --version
This validated that my Kali Linux environment was configured and ready for scanning.

2. Basic Scan
I ran a standard scan against the legal Nmap test host: nmap scanme.nmap.org
This scan identified: Host availability, Common open ports, Visible network services

3. Advanced Scan (Aggressive Mode)
I performed a more detailed scan using: nmap -A scanme.nmap.org
This enabled: OS detection, Service version detection, Default scripts, Basic traceroute information
This scan provided deeper insight into how Nmap gathers reconnaissance data used in real penetration tests.

4. OS Detection Scan
I used: nmap -O scanme.nmap.org
This attempted to fingerprint the operating system based on network behavior and signature comparisons.
