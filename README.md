Cybersecurity Home Lab – AlZubair Helal

This repository contains my personal cybersecurity home lab projects built in a Kali Linux virtual machine and a vulnerable Metasploitable2 host.  
Each project includes documentation of hands-on skills I practiced to learn real-world IT and security concepts.

Project 1 – Network Verification (Kali Linux)

Goal: Confirm that the Kali Linux VM is properly connected to the network and can communicate externally.

Highlights:
- Checked network interfaces and IP configuration.
- Verified connectivity with ICMP and DNS.
- Collected basic troubleshooting commands and outputs.

Folder: `Project 1 - Network Verification/`

Project 2 – Nmap Scanning (Reconnaissance)

Goal: Perform basic and intermediate network scans against legal targets using Nmap.

Highlights:
- Verified Nmap installation and version.
- Ran basic scans against scanme.nmap.org.
- Collected scan results and documented open ports / services.

Project 3 – Vulnerable Lab (Kali + Metasploitable2)

Goal: Build a safe, isolated lab with Metasploitable2 and practice enumeration, vulnerability discovery, and post-exploitation basics.

Highlights:
- Set up Kali (attacker) and Metasploitable2 (target) in a private virtual network.
- Performed basic scans, service enumeration, and vulnerability enumeration.
- Practiced simple exploitation and post-exploitation inspection.
- All activity kept inside an isolated home lab environment.

Skills Demonstrated

- Virtualization (VirtualBox/VMware)
- Linux CLI and system inspection
- Network troubleshooting and verification
- Nmap scanning and enumeration
- Vulnerability discovery fundamentals
- Building and documenting cybersecurity home labs

All testing is performed only against legal, controlled lab systems.
