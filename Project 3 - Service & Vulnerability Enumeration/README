Project 3 – Vulnerable Lab (Kali + Metasploitable2)

Goal
Build a safe, isolated vulnerable lab using Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 to practice enumeration, basic exploitation, and post-exploitation inspection.

Lab Setup
- Attacker: Kali Linux VM  
- Target: Metasploitable2 VM  
- Both VMs placed on an internal / host-only or NAT network
- Verified connectivity between Kali and Metasploitable2
- Ensured the lab is isolated from any production or external networks

Activities

1. Basic Scanning
- Performed initial host discovery and port scans from Kali against Metasploitable2.
- Identified open ports and services.

2. Service & Vulnerability Enumeration
- Enumerated services running on discovered ports.
- Used Nmap scripts and other tools to gather more detailed information.
- Identified potentially vulnerable services and misconfigurations.

3. Exploitation Examples
- Ran sample exploitation steps against known vulnerable services (e.g., FTP / Samba in Metasploitable2).
- Observed the impact and confirmed exploitation via command output and screenshots.

4. Post-Exploitation Inspection
- Enumerated system information and network connections (e.g. `ifconfig`, `netstat`).
- Searched for interesting / sensitive files on the target.
- Demonstrated what an attacker can see after compromise.

Screenshots
All screenshots related to this lab are stored in:

`Project 3 - Vulnerable Lab/screenshots/`

and are referenced in the write-up.

Skills Demonstrated
- Building and isolating a vulnerable lab
- Host and service enumeration
- Vulnerability identification using Nmap and Metasploitable2
- Basic exploitation and post-exploitation concepts
- Linux command-line usage and documentation

All work was performed only inside a controlled home lab environment on intentionally vulnerable systems.
