In this project, I verified that my Kali Linux virtual machine was properly connected to the network and able to communicate externally. I performed several foundational diagnostics:

1. Identified Network Interfaces and IP Address
Using the command ip a, I located the active network interface and confirmed that the VM received a valid IP address from the virtual network.

2. Verified ICMP Connectivity
By running ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS), I confirmed that the VM could reach external networks, proving outbound network connectivity.

3. Verified DNS Resolution
I used ping -c 4 google.com to ensure that DNS was functioning correctly and the system could translate domain names into IP addresses.

These checks confirm that the VM is configured correctly and ready for further cybersecurity tools and testing.
